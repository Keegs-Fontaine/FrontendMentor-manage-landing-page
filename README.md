## My process

- I start setting up the basic reset styling and boilerplate SCSS.
- I then work based on each component. I'll complete the HTML for a single component, then immediately do the related styling (similar to a workflow typical of a JS framework)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Custom JS Slider (normally would've used a library, instead did entirely vanilla. While it's not perfect, proud how it ended up)

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

I learned how to propery organize lots of css styling using SCSS, organizing it into a components and globals folder, with separate SCSS partials in each.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

I would love to continue learning SCSS features, as well as figuring out how to complete sites like these in more efficient ways.
